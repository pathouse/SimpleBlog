# README

Learning to write Web apps with Go.
The goal of this project is to use as few packages outside of the standard lib as possible.

I learned a lot from reading the code here: https://github.com/jadekler/git-go-websiteskeleton

This is a toy project for learning so there are a lot of comments in there that don't need to be.
ie. I'll include the description of various stdlib functions.
